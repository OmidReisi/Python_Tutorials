//in linux in order to use storage volumes they need to be mounted and you can access them via the mount point

lsblk       // show all the storage devices connected to the system

you can access every storage device with /dev/<storage name>

//names like sda, sdb, sdc, ... and nvme0n1, nvme0n2, nvme0n3 ,... are used for storage devices
//but sda1, sda2 or nvme0n1p1, nvme0n1p2 are used for partitions inside storage devices

//for every partion and storage device connected to the system there is a block special file in the path of it's name (for example if you run ls -l /dev/sda1 there is a /dev/sda1 file that it's permission string starts with b)



mount       //show all mounted storage partitions on the system (there are some system partions as well)

mount | grep <partion name>     //show only the mounted partition with the given name


//in order to wipe a storage device it's better to unmount the partitions first

sudo umount <path to partion name (like /dev/sda1) or the path it's mounted to (like /media/omid/disk)


// you can wipe your storage volume with the fdisk command and make a partion table (always use GPT) to re-partion it.

sudo fdisk <storage name like (/dev/sda)        //enter the fdisk mode for the storage volume(remember to always excute the write command with "w" to make the changes final)

sudo mkfs.<format type> <path to partion name (like /dev/sda1)     // format a newly partioned storage device (you can add -n <label> to give it a label)

//popular format types are "btrfs", "exfat", "ext4", ...
//if you want to use your storage device on multipe systems like a flash drive use "exfat" file system
// fat32 is another good option but it has 4G limit for file size and maximum of 2T for storage device


in order to install exfat support for linux distributions follow:

1.for debain and ubuntu use sudo apt install exfat-utils exfat-fuse
2.for cetos and redhat use sudo dnf install fuse-exfat exfat-utils
3.for arch use pacman -S fuse-exfat exfat-utils


df -h       //show used and available space on mounted partions


//sometimes you need to mount a storage partion manually and this means to assign a directory for it's access point

//for temp storages use /media(external storage)
//for permanant storages use /mnt(internal storage)

//make a directory for the mount point in the appropriate location

sudo mount <partion name (like /dev/sda1)> <target mount point (like /mnt/disk1/)       //mount a partion to its mount point (in this case "disk1" is the directory we created for mount point)
