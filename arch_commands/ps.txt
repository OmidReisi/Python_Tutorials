//this command shows what processes are running on our server or system

ps      //lists the processes running in current instance of terminal with their ID,the terminal number that process is running on,time consumption of cpu,and the actual command running on the process

ps x        //shows all processes running in the  whole system

ps -He      //shows the process hierarchy in the whole system

ps -axjf    //shows all processes with full details(parentid,userid,parentgroupid,status,terminalid)

//status ids: s(root process),S(process in uninterrupted sleep and waiting for user input),R(actively running),T(terminated process)
// 0 is root userid, and first manually created userid is 1000

ps aux      //shows cpu and memory usage as well and replaces userid with username (this is the most useful command)

//if you create aliases in the terminal they're bound to that terminal session and will be deleted when that session closes.

//in order to make your aliases permanant you need to add them to your ~/.bashrc for each user
