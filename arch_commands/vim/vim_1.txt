//vim is the default text editor for most linux distributions

//when you startup vim or open a file with it you are in "command mode"

//in order to go to "insertion mode" you press i (doesn't change the position of the cursor)

//press "esc" to return to "command mode"

// in order to save changes type ":w" in "command mode" followed by a "file name" to save the changes if you opened vim in buffer mode (opened vim without specifying a file)

// if you add a file name after ":w" when you've already opened a file with vim it saves the changes to the new file

// ":q" in "command mode" to quit the vim

//when in "command mode" press "shift + a" (capital a) to go to "insertion mode" (puts the cursor at the end of the file)

// ":q!" to quit without saving the changes

// in "command mode" press "u" to undo the last change

//in "command mode" press "ctrl + r" to redo changes

//you can stack commands as well e.g. type ":wq" to save and quit

// in "command mode" press "0" to go to the start of the line and "$" to go to the end of the line (home, end keys do the same things respectively)
