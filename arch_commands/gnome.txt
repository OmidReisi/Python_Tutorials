// gnome (pronounced "nome") is one of the best desktop environments for linux

//gnome supports dynamic workspaces and you can have multiple desktops working at the same time (there is always an empty desktop)

//you can switch desktops with super(win key)+page_up or super+page_down

// pressing the super button brings up the activity menu
