su -        //switch to root

//sudo allows to use root privileges for normal users that have sudo privileges
//to install sudo in arch use pacman -S sudo
//based on the distribution of a linux machine users should be part of "sudo" or "wheel" group to have sudo privilages  (for arch it's wheel)
//to see which group have sudo privilages see the following file as root: /etc/sudoers
//the line that says allow to execute any command shows which group have sudo privilages


sudo -l     //shows what the sudo allows you to do (for e.g. (ALL : ALL) ALL means you can do everything)

sudo !!     //run the previous command with sudo

//the /etc/sudoers file contains different users,groups and their privileges
// for example privileges look like this ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
//first ALL shows the host or server that you're allowd to execute commands on (usually it's ALL)

root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL   //the second ALL shows the users we can impersonate
//the third ALL shows the groups we can impersonate
//the last ALL show the commands we can execute

//never edit the /etc/sudoers file directly with an editor
//in order to edit the /etc/sudoers file use the following command: EDITOR=nano visudo
//using visudo allows us to catch mistakes and makes the file secure.
//if visudo catches an error it shows what now?
//after seeing what now? here are your options:
e       //for re-editing
x       //for not saving the changes
q       //save the invalid changes (never use this)

//for example we add the following user

useradd tux

//then we add the following via visudo

tux     ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: <path to rm>,<path to pacman>
//if you add the "NOPASSWD:" you don't need to type your password when using sudo

//in order to find the path to a command type which <command>
