docker run -it -d <docker image>       //adding the -d switch keeps the container running in the background (the deamon(service) mode that keeps the service running in the background)

docker attach <container ID>        //bring a background container to the foreground

docker stop <container ID>      //to stop a container(exit from a background container)

//you can shorten a <container ID> by as many characters as you want if it's distinguishable from other IDs

//press "ctrl + pq" to put a container in the background
