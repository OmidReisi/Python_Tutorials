//grep stands for global regular expression print

//with grep you can search for texts in files

cat <path to file> | grep <text>    //show only lines that contain text

cat <file> | grep -v port      //show  lines that don't contain port (-v reverses the command)

grep <text> <path to file>        //you can also use grep without piping it with the cat command

// adding the -n switch shows the line number of search result in the file

// -c switch prints the number of times that <text> appears in the <file>

//by default grep is case-sensitive and adding the -i switch makes it case-insensitive

grep <text> *       //show every instance of every file that has the text in the current working directory

// adding the -r switch searchs from the current working directory downward recursively
