//some containers have an entry point command that keep the container running

//for example "nginx" which is a popular proxy and web server application has an entry point command that keep the container running and does not get back to shell

//by default this container is completely useless because we can't even access it and by default we can't even access an application by default via tcp/ip when it's running inside a container

docker run -it -d -p 8080:80 nginx      //-p allows you to specify a port

//by default like most web servers nginx runs on port 80

//by default ports that are open inside a container are not accessable outside of container

//so if we need to access a port inside a container we need to create a port mapping from a local port on the host system to the port inside the container

//so in above command we're mapping port 8080 from the host to port 80 of the container

ip addr show (or "ip a" for short)      //show the ip address of your host

ipconfig        //same as above for windows

//type "host_ip:8080" in a browser to see the nginx welcome message

//type "localhost:8080" to do the same without using your ip address

//adding "--restart unless-stoped" switch to the docker run command keeps the container running unless the "docker stop" command ir run with it(for example "ctrl + c" restarts the container and doesn't stop it)

docker run -it -d --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:80 nginx     //keep the nginx runnning unless it's specifically stopeed with "docker stop"
