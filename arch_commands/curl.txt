//curl is a utility that allows us to transfer or get data from a network server with the supported protocols

//the supported protocols are: http, https, ftp, ftps, sftp, dftp, ...

curl <server>	//see the contents of the server (usually it's html)

//it's very important that you specify the protocol before the server (e.g. https://google.com)

curl -o <path to save the contents> <server>	//save the output to the given path

//by default curl doesn't redirect the url in order to handle redirects add the -L switch

curl -I <server>	//see the response headers instead of the response itself

curl -v <server>	//see the connection details like the tls handshake and advanced connection details
