// ncdu is a tool to manage storage spaces on your server or workstation

sudo pacman -ncdu


sudo ncdu <path>       //scan from the given path and list the files and directories with their useage rate

sudo ncdu /     //scan from root (all storage devices)


//you can navigate the directories and enter them (with enter key)
//press q to exit from ncdu

//adding the -x switch ignores the external mounted devices like flash devices and only shows the local file system hierarchy
