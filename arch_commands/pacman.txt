pacman -Syu         //full system upgrade (it's better to run this command regularly)

pacman -Syy         //force the local mirrorlist to be updataed (/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist)

// to generate a mirrorlist you can visit https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist and generate a mirrorlist by selecting countries you want and server protocols (check the "use mirror status" box)
// then back up your current mirrorlist with cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.bak
//then truncate the original mirrorlist with truncate -s 0 mirrorlist (setting the file size to 0)
//paste the generated mirrorlist in and uncomment some of the servers
//finally run pacman -Syy to make sure changes take effect

pacman -S <pkg1> <pkg2> ...     //install any number of packages

pacman -R <pkg1> <pkg2> ... //remove any number of packages(use pacman -Rs to remove dependancies that are not used anymore as well)

pacman -Ss <keyword>        //search for a package name by passing a keyword

pacman -Qdt     //show orphan packages (orphan packages are dependancies that are not needed anymore and it's better to clean them up)

pacman -U <path to package>     //install a pacakge the is stored in your local machine
