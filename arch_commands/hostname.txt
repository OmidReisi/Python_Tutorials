//hostname is usually shown after the @ sign in prompt

hostname        //see your hostname

//hostname is stored on /etc/hostname

hostnamectl     //gives you your hostname with some extra information

sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <new-hostname>        //change the hostname

//you need to reboot in order for changes to take effect

//you can set your hostname to a domain as well (like hostname.domain.com) but the bash prompt only shows hostname up untill the first "."

//after setting your hostname you need to update the /etc/hosts file as well and set the following:

127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       hostname.domain.com hostname        //the first part is unnecessary if you don't have a domain name
