history     //list of commands that have been run

!{command-id}       //re-run a command from history

//! is called bang in linux community

sudo !{command-id}      //re-run a command from history with sudo privileges

!!      //re-run the last command

sudo !!     //re-run the last command with sudo privileges


//in order to add data and time of commands in history go to .bashrc file in your home directory
// and set the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable to HISTTIMEFORMAT="%Y-%m-%d %T " (space at the end is intentional)
// setting the HISTCONTROL variable to HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth does not save the commands that start with a extra space at the begining
// and this is a good thing because sometimes you run a command that contains sensitive information and you don't want that information to be shown in history so you run that command with a space at the begining


history <num>       //show the last num of commands

history | grep <term>       //show the commands in history that contain <term>

using ctrl+r shortcut brings up a search in commands history and you can start typing to find the command that matches in history(press ctrl+r again to find the next match,ctrl+c to break out of this search)
