//chage command (read as sage) allows us to manage acount and password expirations.

sudo chage -E <date:2022-5-10> <username>       //change the expiration date for a user

sudo chage -l <username>        //show the expiration for user 

sudo chage -M <num> <username>      //set the maximum number of days between password changes for user

//-1 means that password never expires

sudo chage -m <num> <username>      //set the minimum number of days between password changes

sudo passwd -l <username>       //lock a user out

sudo passwd -u <username>       //unlock a user
