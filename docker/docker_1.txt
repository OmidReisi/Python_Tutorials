//docker is a platform that runs containers

//a container bundles an application's code and all it's dependencies into one object

//containers typically use less resources than virtual machines

//docker containers can run almost everywhere, if docker is installed on the host a container can be run on the host like a server, laptop, desktop, virtual machine, ...

//containers can be easily copied and deployed (it's easier to deploy a container than a VM because it's lighter)

//just like VMs applications that run in containers are seperated from the rest of the host system (this adds a bit of a security benefit)

//containers can often be cheaper to run than VMs (you can run more containers than VMs on a specific host)

//docker containers can be run on platforms such as AWS, Linode, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud, and others

//not all apps are supported when run in containers(some companies don't support their apps being run in containers)

//performance can sometimes be inconsistent

//docekr containers are essentially linux containers and they best preform on linux systems

//if you run docker containers on different OS than linux-distributions, they're going to be run on a linux VM and there might be a slight performance hit
