//you can split a screen between two files as well

//open the first file and in "command mode" type ":split <path to file>" to open the second file in split mode (split them horizontally)

//use ":vsplit <path to file>"(or ":vs" for short) to open them in vertical split mode

//the file that it's name is bold is the file that you control

//to switch the file you control press "ctrl + ww" in "command mode"

//you can open the same file twice in split mode as well, in this case changing the file updates it in both splits live
